WE ARE NOT GOING TO USE DATABASE FOR THIS PROJECT

To get morrila mux you need to import it from github using `go get github.com/gorilla/mux`

Since we are dealing with apis, we are working with JSON!! We will need to import `encoding/json` for encoding and decoding.

Encoding -> datatype to json
Decoding -> json to datatype
We wll need an Encoder to carry out the actions.
